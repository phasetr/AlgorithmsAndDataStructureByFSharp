# Algorithms and Data Structures by the F# language

## Motivation

I'd like to write codes for algorithms and data structures **by F#**.

We have many many books for them in **imperative or objective-oriented** languages,
but we have few books in functional languages.
We have some famous books in functional languages,
but they are difficult to me.
And, for some reasons, I'd like to study the themes by F#.
Some comments are here.

- Richard Bird, Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design, written by Haskell:
  This is very difficult and we meet many unusual themes in it.
  I'd like to study usual themes.
  Furthermore it treats only algorithms.
- Chris Okasaki, Purely Functional Data Structures, written by SML and Haskell:
  We have only data structure themes in this book,
  and small amount of them.
- Masood, Learning F# Functional Data Structures and Algorithms written by F#:
  The codes in this book is written by imperative style, I think.
  I'd like to study functional style algorithms.
- [vkostrykov, scalacaster](https://github.com/vkostyukov/scalacaster) written by Scala:
  Data structure objects seem to be mutable objects.
  I'd like to study immutable style.
- Rabhi and Lapalme, Algorithms A Functional Programming Approach written by Haskell:
  This looks more algorithms than others.

Hence I decide to write codes by myself.
